## Aim:
To practice solution ideation, user story creation, scenario development, flow mapping, and information architecture design to improve user experience through structured UX design activities.

## Problem Statement:

Solution Ideation: Use a known UX problem (e.g., ordering food via a food delivery app).
Task: Conduct a Crazy 8s or Brainwriting Ideation exercise and generate multiple low-fidelity ideas.

Creating User Stories: Use personas and their goals to write user stories.
Task: Write at least 5 user stories using this format:
As a [user], I want to [goal], so that [benefit].

Creating Scenarios: Select a user story.
Task: Create a narrative scenario that describes the user in context, including emotional states, tasks, and environment.

Flow Diagrams / Flow Mapping: Choose a task (e.g., ordering food via app).
Task: Draw a task flow diagram or user flow using standard symbols.

Information Architecture (IA): Take an example website or app (e.g., food delivery app).
Task: Perform card sorting (open or closed) and create a site map showing categorized structure.
